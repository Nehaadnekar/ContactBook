                        Contact Book is primarily meant for keeping the records of the persons. Records consist 
of their name, office address, home address, email id, designation, phone numbers etc. It is designed for people to store the 
information about their contacts. Rather than going through the pages of their diaries and 
copies to search a person information, a person can simply use this software to view any 
of his stored contacts. A user can also add or update or delete the contact information 
according to his need
